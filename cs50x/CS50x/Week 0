What is computer science? Input->|_|->Output
Unary -> i.e. counting one finger at a time
Binary -> from binary digit 'bit' aka zeros and ones that represent on and off

Computers use base-2 to count, i.e.
2^2  2^1  2^0
4    2    1

8 bits are in a byte
maximum is 256 bits if you include zero

Bits can be mapped, i.e. numbers to letters with ASCII. 

Unicode standards expanded the number of bits that can be trasnmitted and understood by computers.

RGB is a combination of all three numbers
Images are a collection of RGB
Videos are sequences of images stored together
Music can be represented as MIDI

Abstraction - focusing on higher level processes

Algorithms - a list set of instructions to solve problems or perform tasks, based on the understanding of available alternatives

pseudocode - human readable version of code
it uses verbs (functions)
it uses statements like if, else if (conditionals)
True or False (boolean expressions)
it uses cycles (loops)

Scratch - visual programming language developed at MIT
